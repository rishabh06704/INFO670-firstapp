My Bucket List App
Design and Purpose:
My Bucket List is a simple mobile app designed to help users keep track of their life goals and aspirations. Intended audience can be anyone, a busy professional, a student, or anyone with a desire to live life to the fullest. With My Bucket List, users can easily create, manage, and prioritize their bucket list items.

Basic Use:

Launch the app on your mobile device.
Users will be greeted with a simple interface.
To add a new item to the bucket list, simply type it into the input field at the bottom of the screen and tap the "Add" button.
User's new item will appear in the list above.
To mark an item as completed, simply tap on it. The item's text will be struck through, indicating that the user has achieved that goal.
If the user changes their mind, they can just tap the item again to remove the strikethrough and mark it as incomplete.
